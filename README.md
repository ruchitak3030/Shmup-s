Space Shooter belongs to Shoot ’em up genre games. In this game, the player character engages in a lone assault, shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. This game has a side-view perspective, and players must use ranged weapons to take action at a distance.

Here, player’s avatar is typically a weapon under constant attack. Thus, the player’s goal is to shoot as quickly as possible all the alien spaceships. Here, the player’s spaceship can withstand maximum 3 attacks. This game is aimed at fast reactions and memorising enemy attack patterns.

Space Shooter’s design elements include fixed shooters which restrict the protagonist to a single axis of motion. The background of the game includes stars which are in constant top-down motion, providing the player a sense of top-down movement.
